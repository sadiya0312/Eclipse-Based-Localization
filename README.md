## Ready to navigate outside the world
### Thank you for landing on our evolving project page.
You are here because you wanted to explore the Moon. The Moon - every astro-explorer's favorite. To get you excited chcek out our [website](https://alyssabethl.github.io/eclipse-nav/index.html)  
Let me show you a different side of Monn through this project. But first you have to run the project.
In order to run this project you need to understand its structure. 
### The project consist of seven folders.
  * Initial input - consist of files and path to download files that are required to start the project.
  * Lunar disk - has code to detect the lunar disk during the time of total eclipse
  * Observer at X direction - initial attempt to extract lunar limb without considering the location of observer
  * Earth based Moon Position - has code to extract lunar limb considering the location of the observer.
  * Detecting beads - has code to map intensity of light in a picture and then using this intensity of light detect beads. Bailey's bead is plotted taking top 10 brightest beads.
  * Crater overlay - an attempt to overlay the crater data obtained from a repository on our Total Eclipse photograph. This folder is a work in progress and is not complete yet with all accuracy.
  * website -has code to our website for this project.
### To run this project it is required that you install certain python packages including OpenCv, skyfield, numpy, matplotlib, pillow e.t.c. Files are large so either choose a high power PC or
it will run for a very long time.
## Description
The project is an attempt to localize an observer based on lunar topography. Our [website](https://alyssabethl.github.io/eclipse-nav/index.html) explains the goal and purpose of this project clearly. 
It started as a curiosity to explore an eclipse photograph that captured Baily's Beads. It quickly evolved into a project capable of locating a person using a eclipse photograph.
