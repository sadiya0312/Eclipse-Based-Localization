    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        In April 2024, North America had the opportunity to witness a total solar eclipse, an awe-inspiring celestial event with significant astronomical implications. 
        It is a unique opportunity to study both solar and lunar characteristics under exceptional astronomical conditions. During this brief period of lunar occultation, 
        researchers can analyze various optical phenomena. One such phenomenon is Baily’s Beads, the transient bead-like flashes of sunlight that appear along the moon's edges (aka the lunar limb)
        just before and after totality.

        In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using Baily’s Beads as geospatial markers to infer the precise geographical location of eclipse observations on Earth.
        Our approach integrates computational modeling of the lunar limb profile with high-resolution eclipse photography to establish a correlation between the observed sequence 
        of Baily’s Beads and the observer’s terrestrial coordinates .The methodology is as follows: pre-processing image data of lunar craters and Baily’s Beads, overlaying the images, 
        calculating the lunar coordinates of the responsible craters, calculating the observer’s coordinates, and verifying the accuracy of the results.

        This methodology introduces a novel approach of eclipse-based geolocation, with potential implications for refining solar eclipse path predictions, enhancing precision in lunar 
        limb characterization, and contributing to celestial navigation techniques. The findings of this study has implications for improving eclipse predictions, refining lunar elevation 
        models, and enhancing public engagement in astronomical observations.
