        <li><b>Phase 1:</b> In Phase 1 we collect data for Bailey’s beads as well as lunar to- pography. Bailey’s beads data will be collected from NASA’s 
            Flickr account where photographs from 8 April 2024 are posted while the lunar topographic data are obtained from <a href="https://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/"> the Washington University 
            repository for geosciences</a>. Image processing and extraction of different features from this data is a major step before we move on to Phase 2.

<!--- Image Processing -->

    <h2>Image Processing</h2>
    <p>
        Preliminary image exploration is done using MATLAB. In this process, we first read the lunar elevation data in binary format. We then defined image 
        dimensions based on metadata from the accompanying LBL (Label) file, specifying 15360 rows and 46080 columns. Since the raw binary data is stored in row-major 
        order, the matrix is transposed to match the correct spatial orientation of the lunar surface. Without transposition, the dataset would be flipped along its 
        axes, leading to incorrect interpretations of the topographic features. The elevation values are then converted from Digital Numbers (DN) to absolute height in 
        kilometers using linear transformation. The processed elevation matrix is visualized using MATLAB which scales and displays the elevation data as a grayscale 
        image.

        Our initial investigation of eclipse photograph obtained from NASA Flickr account involve detection of moon edge at the time of total eclipse and obtaining 
        its geometric points. These points are stored in eclipse geometry.npy. The photograph used for this purpose is from a speedway in Indiana. Our first step is 
        to convert the image to gray scale and then apply gaussian blur. This will reduce the noise and make the edges of the desired object (Moon) more coherent. 
        Now to detect circle in the modified image we use Hough Circles function of OpenCV.

<!--- Quantitative Analysis of Light Intensity in an Eclipse Image -->
    <h2>Quantitative Analysis of Light Intensity in an Eclipse Image</h2>
    <p>
        Before we can map the craters on to the Baily’s bead, it is important to first identify the Baily’s bead in a photograph. For this purpose, we analyzed 
        the light intensity of the photograph using radial-azimuthal intensity map. It is a 2D map with the X-axis indicating how far an observer is from the center
        of the moon and y-axis indicates which direction around the moon an observer is looking. If an observer move its head in the clockwise direction, the 
        brightness scan is done outward from the center. It is essential a heatmap. It is created from the coor- dinates stored in eclipse geometry.npy from the 
        previous moon detection in the photograph. Upon examination of the radial azimuthal map, the occurrence and position of Baily’s bead is clear. This map will
        be different for each photograph but can serve as a Baily’s bead detection method in the pipeline[11].

    </figure>
    <p>
        Further, we plotted limb brightness map. In this map, brightness is plotted as a function of the angle (azimuth) around the disk. Using this map we can count 
        the number of beads, find the crater causing each beads, and also estimate the time of totality with frequent analysis of bead appearance and disappearance. 
        Given the Eclipse photograph from speedway, Indiana during the time of totality 135 potential beads are detected. This is because during the time of totality 
        Moon completely covers the Sun, leaving extreme bright light emerging from the disk of the Moon. This represents Sun’s corona.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        For better visualization, we overlayed these prospective Baily’s beads on an eclipse image. Baily’s beads are known to appear as intensely bright spots along 
        the lunar limb, often exceeding the brightness of the surrounding solar corona. Leveraging this characteristic, we extracted the top 10 points with the 
        highest limb brightness values from our intensity profile and marked them on the image. These selected peaks were spatially clustered toward the lower-right
        quadrant of the Moon’s disk, which strongly suggests the actual appearance of Baily’s beads in that region. The distinct concentration of these bright 
        features, in conjunction with their solar prominence in the region, provides reliable evidence of the bead phenomenon in the given eclipse photograph. 
        This approach demonstrates that by analyzing brightness peaks along the lunar limb and mapping them back onto the eclipse im- age, we can objectively 
        verify the presence of Baily’s beads without relying solely on visual inspection.

<!--- Plotting Lunar Limb -->

    <h2>Plotting Narrow Lunar Limb</h2>
    <p>
        This step of the project require thoughtful consideration of angle on Earth from where we are looking at the Moon. For this purpose, we explored 
        two analytical approaches. The results clearly indicated which one was more suitable for adop- tion. We refer to our first approach as the “Observer 
        at +X direction” method, and the second as the "Earth-based Moon Position" method.

    <b>Observer at +X Direction Method</b>
    <p>
        The image processing of a global lunar image provides a broad overview of craters and other topographical features. However, it does not effectively 
        distinguish in- dividual craters, mountains, valleys, or their depths. Since Baily’s Beads are a direct result of the Moon’s limb topography, it is essential 
        to extract and analyze its features at a microscopic level for precise characterization. Considering a SLDEM global lunar image, we can conclude that the image
        spans +60° to -60° latitude and 0° to 360° longitude at a resolution of 128 pixels/degree. There are other global lunar images available that are mapped at 
        +60° to -60° latitude. We might consider those images latter in the project for better accuracy. For adding the elevation data to the image we converted it 
        to meters and added to the Moon’s reference radius (1737.4 km) to get the absolute radius at each grid point. We then created latitude and longitude grids and 
        converted it to radians. Using the planeto centric model, the DEM data is converted into Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) where <em>R</em> is the absolute radius, 
        <em>lat</em> is the latitude, and <em>lon</em> is the longitude.

        To extract limb points of the Moon, we have to set an arbitrary viewpoint. We assume that the observer is positioned along the +X direction, represented 
        by the observer vector (1.0, 0.0, 0.0). The algorithm begins by computing unit vectors for all surface points relative to the Moon’s center, effectively 
        normalizing their positions in planetocentric coordinates. These unit vectors represent the direction of each surface point in 3D space. To determine whether
        a point lies on the limb, the algorithm calculates the dot product between the unit vector of the Moon’s surface and the observer’s unit vector.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        A point qualifies as a limb point if its angular separation falls within the range of 88° to 92°, ensuring that it is approximately perpendicular to the 
        observer’s line of sight along the X-axis. The choice of this range accounts for small variations in surface elevation, preventing the exclusion of valid 
        limb points due to minor topographic fluctuations. Once the valid limb points are identified, they are stored in the global array called <em>LIMB POINTS</em>, which 
        contains their corresponding (x, y, z) Cartesian coordinates. Simultaneously it generates a numpy file (limbpoints.npy) to store the coordinates. This 
        dataset can be used for visualization and further analysis. The narrow lunar limb is mapped by identifying and ex- tracting limb points from the dataset. 
        A total of approximately 19.8 million limb points are recognized, representing the fine-scale topographical variations along the Moon’s limb. However, 
        plotting all 19.8 million points at once is impractical due to computational constraints and visualization clarity. To address this, we apply a down sampling 
        technique, selectively skipping a subset of points to reduce data density while preserving the essential structure of the limb. The down sampled limb points 
        are then projected into a 3D plot, allowing for a clearer and more interpretable visualization of the lunar limb’s curvature and topographical features. 
        This approach ensures efficient rendering while maintaining the integrity of the observed limb structure. A 3D image displaying actual spatial distribution of 
        limb points around the Moon is represented in the below figure.

        The file <em>limb_points.py</em> is used to generate X angular offset and Y angular offset. Upon converting these offsets to degrees we obtain the Moon’s limb as seen from Earth 
        in angular space(observer at X direction). These values are then projected on a graph. Before moving forward with this approach, we realized we can improve on 
        accuracy and efficiency by using the second method.

    <b>Earth-based Moon Position</b>
    <p>
        Our second method to calculate the Moon’s limb from the observer's location include advanced package like skyfield along with latitude/longitude of the place where 
        photograph is taken. In this method we are not making any assumption regarding the location of the observer. For lunar limb estimation we extracted real 
        astronomy ephemeris data from the Skyfield package and real lunar topography from SLDEM2015. Skyfield provide us with Earth-Moon vector to simulate how moon 
        appears from a given location on Earth (in this case, Speedway, Indiana).
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Once the lunar limb is plotted successfully, we load the crater data from <a href="https://zenodo.org/" target="_blank">Zenodo</a>, a universal, open source, research data repository managed by CERN and 
        OpenAIRE. Specific craters belonging to the Lunar limb are extracted from this data. The three-dimensional morphological information of craters along the lunar 
        limb plays a pivotal role in this project, as it enables us to determine which specific crater(visible from the observer’s location) is responsible for 
        producing the observed Baily’s bead. We begin by filtering the crater database to remove small or shallow craters that are unlikely to contribute meaningfully 
        to the limb profile at the observed resolution. The remaining crater coordinates, originally defined in latitude and longitude, are then transformed into 3D unit
        vectors on a spheri- cal model of the Moon. This transformation allows us to represent each crater as a point on the unit sphere, which is geometrically 
        consistent with the way limb points are derived from the observer’s perspective.

    <p>
        For spatial querying, we construct a KDTree using the 3D crater vectors. This data structure supports efficient nearest-neighbor searches and significantly 
        reduces the computational overhead involved in matching features. Each limb point obtained from the lunar limb detection process is then used as a query to 
        identify its closest corresponding crater. This association between limb points and known craters forms the basis for tracing Baily’s beads back to their 
        topographic origin, ultimately linking observed photometric features in eclipse imagery to specific geological formations on the Moon.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        From the crater database, small craters are filtered out and lat/lon of these craters are converted to 3D unit vectors on a sphere, which allows for efficient
        geometric distance comparisons. We create a KDTree for fast nearest-neighbor search for our craters. We then use limb points from lunar limb detection process
        to query nearest crater to each limb point.

        3D surface geometry is obtained from SLDEM2015 and moon’s angular diameter is calculated. Based on view angle and Moon’s angular radius we compute which
        points lie along the limb. Limb points and Limb lat/long are stored in numpy array. In next step, we combine the stored limb points from the skyfield and
        the eclipse image geometry to overlay the selected limb points that appear on then limb from the observer’s view. These pixel coordinates of the limb are
        then stored in another numpy array.
