    <h2>What Are Baily's Beads Anyway?</h2>
    <p>
        During a total solar eclipse, when the Moon completely covers the Sun, some sunlight escapes from the edges in an irregular pattern. 
        This phenomenon occurs due to the rugged surface of the Moon, where valleys and craters allow small bursts of sunlight to pass through,
        forming what is known as Baily’s beads. This effect was first vividly described by English astronomer, Francis Baily, in 1836, following 
        his observations of an annular solar eclipse. His detailed account led to the epony- mous naming of the phenomenon.

        An important aspect of Baily's Beads is that they do not shine with equal intensity from all craters, lunar mountains, and lunar valleys. 
        We also know that not all lunar topography is visible from everywhere on Earth. With that said, it is inevitable to deduce that the appearance 
        and brightness of Baily’s beads vary depending on the observer’s position.These facts can be utilized to determine the observer’s precise position. 
        By leveraging lunar limb profiles derived from topographic datasets, such as those obtained from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), we reconstruct
        the expected bead patterns for various geographic locations. We then apply image processing and feature extraction techniques to eclipse im- ages to match
        the observed bead sequences with predicted models, thus estimating the photographer’s position.
