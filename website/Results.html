                The initial analysis of the image data, combined with metadata, revealed the pres- ence of craters on the Moon. However, since it is a global
                image, identifying specific craters along the lunar limb responsible for Baily’s Beads remains chal- lenging using only global lunar elevation map.
                While image dilation may aid in highlighting larger features, it is still likely to miss narrow or subtle craters that contribute to the phenomenon.
                The gray scale image might benefit from contrast enhancement like histogram equalization or adaptive contrast enhancement. The raw elevation data 
                might also contain artifacts or noise from the original DEM dataset which can be dealt with common image processing techniques like Gaussian 
                filtering or median filtering could be applied to reduce noise. For the project we can apply edge detection for feature extraction. Due to the size 
                of the image, further processing is not carried out in MATLAB, instead we used OpenCV.

                In the process of building a novel eclipsed-based earth localization method, we were able to accurately detect Baily’s bead using light intensity around
                the lunar limb. This can further be verified by passing multiple photographs through the process. The unique brightness profile of Baily’s beads,
                typically characterized by sharp, localized peaks significantly exceeding the surrounding limb and coronal brightness,served as a key feature for 
                detection. By extracting and ranking the brightest points around the lunar circumference, we were able to isolate candidate beads with high confidence. 
                This detection not only validates the physical mechanism behind the bead phenomenon but also provides a measurable anchor for further geolocation 
                analysis. The reliability of this method can be further strength- ened by applying it to a broader set of eclipse photographs.

                As we opted for Earth-based Moon position method we extracted the lunar limb points in correspondence to observers location and then overlay the lunar limb 
                points (from observers location) accurately on to the eclipse image. In Fig. 13, the SLDEM-derived limb points are accurately mapped along the edge of the 
                eclipsed Moon, revealing fine details in the lunar topography. The granular undulations visible in the overlay correspond to real crater induced variations 
                along the lunar horizon. This alignment confirms that the irregularities in brightness seen in the image are not artifacts, but actual features of the Moon’s 
                limb. Further we obtained improved <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020JE006728" target="_blank"> Global Catalog of Lunar Craters
