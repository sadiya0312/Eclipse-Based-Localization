            <h1>Our Research Platform</h1>
            <h2>Type of Data Collected</h2>
            <p>
            The data collected for this project are the *.JPG images for Bailey’s Bead and SLDEM (high resolution digital elevation model) 
            for Lunar topographical data. The collected SLDEM are the global images of the Moon. SLDEM is a merged DEM (Digital Elevation) Model 
            from LRO’s (Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter) LOLA (Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter) instrument and JAXA’s (Japan Aerospace Explo- ration Agency) 
            Kaguya Terrain. JAXA’s Kaguya Terrain is a high-resolution instrument onboard the Kaguya ( i.e SELENE ( SELenological and ENgineering Explorer)) 
            lunar orbiter. SLDEM images collected are from 2015. They are finely sampled surface profile, including the valleys and ridges along the Moon’s edge. 
            For this project this level of detail is important when pinpointing the small dips that let sunlight pass through during eclipses. SLDEM comprise of 
            *.img and *.lbl files. SLDEM *.img global image obtained is of 2.63 GB while *.lbl file is 4. 47 KB.

            <p>
            Along with the eclipse images and lunar topographical data, we also relied on sky- field data (Moon lunar limb from earth latitude/longitude). For 
            final recognition of craters on the lunar limb we utilized the <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020JE006728" target="_blank">global 
            catalog of lunar craters with 3D morphological information</a>. Finally, there are latitude/longitude and pixels numpy data produced during the processing of images
             which is later used in our analysis.

            <h2>Platform Used</h3>
            <p>
            We used both MATLAB and Python OpenCV for this project. MATLAB allows technical computing including images, audio and video. OpenCV is essential for 
            this project due to its capacity to handle large amount of data. It is implemented using python an does not require desktop IDE. Another requirement 
            for the project is GPU (Graphical Processing Unit). This requirement is fulfilled by Iowa State University NOVA platform which comprises of 20 GPU nodes
            with a total of 60 Nvidia A100 GPUs (80GB GPU RAM) and 5 Nvidia V100–32GB GPUs. We used Nidia V100-32GB GPU for this project.
            For our purpose we used MATLAB for initial image visualization to extract different feature. Baily’s bead image is enhanced for better capture of the light
            <br>
            <br>
            We processed Lunar elevation binary image combined with provided matadata as 32-bit floating-point numbers and then converting digital number to height. 
            This data is again displayed as an image. We used skyfield package to obtain the position of Moon as seen from different locations on Earth. It can also 
            simulate when and where eclipse will occur on Earth. Python libraries essential for this project include: matplotlib, numpy, pillow, scipy, opencv-python, pandas, 
            and skyfield.
